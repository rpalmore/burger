# Burger

Order your dream veggie burger and then ... devour it! Still hungry? You can reorder what you just ate, or try a new burger.

## The assignment
Create a burger logger with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM (yum!). Be sure to follow the MVC design pattern; use Node and MySQL to query and route data in your app, and Handlebars to generate your HTML.

### Instructions:
* Whenever a user submits a burger's name, your app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.
* Each burger in the waiting area also has a Devour it! button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.
* Your app will store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.

## Setup 

```bash
$ npm install
